SpyWords
========

Overview:
---------
A card-based, word-association, guessing game traditionally played with 4 people

From the rulebook:
“Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates, the field operatives, 
know the agents only by their codenames. 
Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a 
wrong person. Then it is the other team’s turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to 
contact all their agents wins the game.”

Improving the Game Mechanics:
One of our main goals is to make the game experience authentic, easier, and more intuitive. 
The web app takes away all the trouble of setup and randomization, 
and removes the chance for illegal communication (such as facial expressions). 
The spy master view will also make it easier to see which words go with which team.
